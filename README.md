# Corelle demo app

This application is a demo of plate-rotation functionality
using the [Corelle](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/corelle)
API and Javascript library for rotations alongside external data
from the Paleobiology database.

Plates and features are rotated directly in the browser, so it is relatively quick and reactive.

This is a web application written in Typescript and packaged with the Parcel web-application bundler.
